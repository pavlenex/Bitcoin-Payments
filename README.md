# Bitcoin Payments

Designing a set of best practices for designers and developers building effective Bitcoin merchants payment applications. These guidelines cover basic interface elements, how to use them and integrate effectively into a seamless interface.

These guidelines are based on industry standards, best-practices and user-research. However, they don't represent a rulebook. Use it as a foundation when developing/designing your applications and feel free to contribute to its expansion and improvement.

The end-goal of this project is to become a part of the payment section of the [@BitcoinDesign](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign/) guide. For more general overview on Bitcoin Payments, check Johns Beharry's [work](https://github.com/peakshift/bitcoin-ux).
