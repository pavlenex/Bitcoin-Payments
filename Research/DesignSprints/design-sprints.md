## Calls, workshops and sprints

This section provides a hierarchal order of the design sprints calls and their brief summary.

### Bitcoin Accepted Here: Merchant Design Workshop #0

Video summary of the call is [available here](https://youtu.be/OGrzjl8A5vg)

On the call #0, we've put ourselves in a position of the merchant accepting Bitcoin payments via [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org) We defined BTCPay Server, the core functionalities and type of users who may use it. 
We defined BTCPay Server as a Bitcoin payment infrastructure, that is thanks to its flexibility similar to the WordPress. BTCPay Server is the WordPress of Bitcoin that allows users to create invoices quickly, get paid and process refunds. Our focus was on online merchant persona, with limited or no access to the banking infrastructure. We've determined that troubleshooting was a big issue due to the amount of steps involved and technical knowledge a merchant needs to posses in order to troubleshoot a payment related problem. The conclusion was that payment processing is not something merchants visit frequently, unless there's a problem that they need to troubleshoot. That's the reason we tried to aim for making troubleshooting and refunding easier.
